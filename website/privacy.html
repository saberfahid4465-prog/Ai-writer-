  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information you provide strictly for the following purposes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>AI Processing</strong> — Your topic text or uploaded document content is sent to our AI service provider (Longcat AI) to generate, translate, or summarize documents. Only the content text is transmitted; no personal identifiers are included.</li>
    <li><strong>Image Search</strong> — Keyword searches are sent to Pexels API to find relevant stock images for your documents. No personal data is included in these requests.</li>
    <li><strong>File Generation</strong> — Your content is used to produce PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files, which are stored exclusively on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Language Detection</strong> — Your device's language setting is read locally to auto-select your preferred output language. This data is never transmitted.</li>
  </ol>

  <!-- 3 -->
  <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Generated files</strong> are stored only on your device. They are never uploaded to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Uploaded content</strong> is processed in-memory and is not stored after the processing session ends.</li>
    <li><strong>AI API requests</strong> — Content sent to the Longcat AI API is processed in real-time. We do not control the data retention practices of the AI provider. Please refer to their privacy policy for details.</li>
    <li><strong>Token counters and preferences</strong> are stored locally via AsyncStorage and can be cleared at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>We do not store your files on any server.</strong> All generated documents remain exclusively on your device unless you choose to share them.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- 4 -->
  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Selling</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your personal data with any third parties.</strong></p>
  <p>The only data transmitted externally is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Document content text sent to Longcat AI API for processing (via HTTPS)</li>
    <li>Image keyword searches sent to Pexels API (via HTTPS)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These transmissions contain no personal identifiers, usernames, device IDs, or tracking information.</p>

  <!-- 5 -->
  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement the following security measures:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Encryption in transit</strong> — All data transmitted between the App and external APIs uses HTTPS/TLS encryption.</li>
    <li><strong>Local storage only</strong> — Files and preferences are stored exclusively on your device's local storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimal permissions</strong> — The App requests only INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions. No dangerous permissions (camera, location, contacts, storage) are requested.</li>
    <li><strong>No authentication</strong> — No user accounts means no credential storage and no risk of account breaches.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- 6 -->
  <h2>6. Cloud Hosting &amp; Infrastructure</h2>
  <p>This website is hosted on <strong>Cloudflare Pages</strong> infrastructure. Cloudflare may collect standard web server logs (IP addresses, request timestamps) in accordance with their own privacy policy. The AI Writer mobile application itself does not use Cloudflare for data processing.</p>

  <!-- 7 -->
  <h2>7. Third-Party AI Processing Disclosure</h2>
  <p>AI Writer uses the <strong>Longcat AI API</strong> to generate, translate, and summarize document content. When you use these features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your topic text or uploaded document content is sent to Longcat AI servers for processing.</li>
    <li>No personal identifiers, device information, or tracking data is included in the API request.</li>
    <li>The AI response is used to create your documents and is not stored by AI Writer after file generation.</li>
    <li>We do not control the data practices of the Longcat AI service. We recommend reviewing their privacy policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>AI Writer also uses the <strong>Pexels API</strong> to source stock images:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Only keyword search terms are sent to Pexels (e.g., "business meeting", "technology").</li>
    <li>No personal data is included in image search requests.</li>
    <li>Images are licensed under the <a href="https://www.pexels.com/license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pexels License</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Right to Deletion</strong> — You can delete all app data at any time by clearing app data (Android Settings → Apps → AI Writer → Clear Data) or uninstalling the app. Since we do not store your data on our servers, deletion is instant and complete.</li>
